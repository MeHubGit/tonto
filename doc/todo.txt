  - open to tree node when re-adding panel (if was open)
  - check linux rpm w/ jre's (paths)
  - used pronto font or use font size in context menus? what about main menu?
  - fix compressed color images
  - replace refreshPanel with repaintPanel in many cases
  - add zoom to view menu
  - property editing for multiple selections
  - 'revert to defaults', 'set defaults' for all preferences tabs
  - backup database on save .. backup use common code + numbered backups .. pref for off
  - better 'dirtied' detection for ccf + ir database
  - copy/paste special uses pieces/alias from button on clipboard? (spee)
  - cut/delete should advance like <tab> or select parent

  - remove dependence on cygwin or get new dll? broken for win98?
  - be able to close all tabs. start with no tabs open?
  - preference to turn of ir auto-clean?
  - hide home device list?
  - auto macro builder

(CONFIRM)
  - aaron'ss 9200 jumps not working in emulator (last jump)
  - revert menu disabled on some platforms? 98SE/ME?
  - can't use web-safe color index for button/frame on 9200? Aaron. ok on 6k.
  - CTRL+arrow doesn't work on Win/Mac?
  - new paint model (selection last) might slow things down

(PREFERENCES)
  - auto-save every x minutes

(BUGS)
  - paste button has drag selection as item in previous ccf. movement bug.
  - sometimes grid/snap toggle menus/tool out of sync w/ no panels selected
  - FIX: ir sending/testing (cole)
  - FIX: record 0100, 7000
  - FIX: 'dispose called when dialog not visible'
  - hitting esc in icon library passes through to button props
  - parent frame boundary occluded by child element
  - spurious undead crash (cancelling it? when done?) that hoses VM & Windows.
  - IR Database doesn't use tonto font
  - fix panel zooming
  - TEST: MoveTo that preserves links
  - resolve lineage for buttons,frames. child of ccfchild or it's parent.
  - pasted action lists should be culled of references to other CCF's

(REFACTOR)
  - move all static utility methods unti a Util class
  - redo ALL ccf structures as tree of hashmapstables using an external schema
  - use different fields for api than for serialization (all vectors for lists)
  - store colors after decode as CCFColor ... convert to int upon encode
  - redo encode/decode + error handling
  - merge/split CCFIRCode and irdb/Pronto code sensibly
  - ui mapping for ccf elements. add change notifiers.
  - streamline ir recording for groups of buttons/remotes. cleaner UI.
  - error reporting for exceptions during encode/decode. need test cases.
  - timers limited to button presses by UI, but maybe don't have to be
  - all debugging should go through debug listeners
  - rewrite tree from scratch then subclass: drag, drop, reorder
  - rewrite CCFPanel renderer from scratch
  - the whole buildtree thing sucks
  - merge updateCCFInfo && updateMenuState?
  - redo ir database

(UNRESOLVED)
  - installer refuses to accept install location (paul caden)
  - network update fails (spee - japanese locale)
  - tabs too narrow for full filename? until next load event.

(DOCS)
  - docs on ir encodings: pulse position (0100) , rc5/6x encoding (5/6000), 7/9000
  - basic howto: getting started
  - tips and tricks: keys, menus, action lists, ir panels
  - troubleshooting guide (comm, etc)

(IR)
  - enable sending/testing of ir codes
  - handle 5000,6000,7000 and 0100 styles in record
  - xmodem xfer is using ccf file size?
  - cancel ir recording doesn't. should close comm.
  - enable 'delete' key in db
  - analysis of ir groups: active bit/change list
  - add "active bitmap" and "true value" to IRBurstCode.
  - move remote cleanup() into IRRemote and add index averaging
  - add index collapse/cull for similar elements
  - TEST: ir recording

(IRDB)
  - check that saved before closing!
  - database should not be modal frame
  - not tied to Tonto instance
  - CCF Import should present load dialog instead or load from all ccf's
  - networked

(MAC)
  - make sure name is highlighted in name dialog on open (seems to be a mac bug)
  - option-command-w to close all panels

(JAVA BUGS)
  - filename filters not working in old-style dialogs (java bug when chg dir)
  - file dialog disables save when descending to child dir
  - osx eats cut/copy/paste events when menu accelerator exists
